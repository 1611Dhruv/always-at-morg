# Game Logic

This directory contains game logic (separate from rendering).

## Purpose

- Player entity logic
- Physics (movement, collision)
- Game state management
- Map data structures
- Entity behaviors

## TODO

Your teammate's termloop game logic can be refactored here.

**Suggested files:**
- `player.go` - Player entity logic
- `physics.go` - Movement and collision
- `map.go` - Map data structures
- `entities.go` - Game entities (collectibles, etc.)
- `state.go` - Local game state
